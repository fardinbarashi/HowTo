## Database
### About Database
```
The database represents the core of One Identity Manager. It fulfills the main tasks, which are managing data and calculating inheritance. Object properties can be inherited along the hierarchical structures, such as departments, cost centers, location, or business roles. For data management, the database maps managed target systems and ERP structures as well as compliance rules and access permissions.

<!-- ROLES JOB SERVER -->
## Job Server
### About Job Server
```
One Identity Manager uses 'processes' for mapping business processes. A process consists of process steps that represent processing tasks and are joined by predecessor/successor relations. This functionality allows flexibility when linking actions and sequences to object events. Processes are modeled using process templates. A process generator (Jobgenerator) is responsible for converting script templates in processes and process steps into a concrete process in the ’Job queue’.
The One Identity Manager Service enables the distribution throughout the network of information that is administrated in the One Identity Manager database. The One Identity Manager Service performs data synchronization between the database and any connected target systems and runs actions at the database and file level. The service must be installed on the One Identity Manager network server to run the processes. A server running the One Identity Manager Service is called the Job server. The Job server must be declared in the One Identity Manager database.
The One Identity Manager Service retrieves process steps from the Job queue. Process steps are run by process components. The One Identity Manager Service also creates an instance of the required process component and transfers the process step parameters. Decision logic monitors the performance of the process steps and determines how processing should continue depending on the results of the run process components. The One Identity Manager Service enables parallel processing of process steps because it can create several instances of process components.
The One Identity Manager Service is the only One Identity Manager component authorized to make changes in the target system.

<!-- ROLES APPLICATION SERVER -->
## Application server
### About Application Server
```
Clients connect to an application server storing business logic. The application server provides a connection pool for accessing the database and ensures a secure connection to the database. Clients send their queries to the application server, which processes the objects, for example, by determining values using templates and sending the results back to the clients. The data from the application is sent to the database when an object is saved.
Clients can alternatively work without external application servers by retaining the object layer themselves and accessing the database layer directly. In this case, only the part of the object layer that is required for the acquisition process is mapped in the clients.

<!-- ROLES WEB SERVER -->
## Web server
### About Web Server
```
To implement browser-based user interfaces, there is an application running on a web server that is based on a website render engine. Users use a web browser to access the website that has been dynamically set up and customized for them. Data exchange between database and web server can take place either directly or through the application server.
Front-ends
There are different front-ends for different tasks. For example, the front-end used to configure One Identity Manager differs from the one for managing identities. The contents to be displayed and the extent to which it can be altered is determined in conjunction with the access permissions of the respective user through the object layer. Available front-end solutions are both client and browser-based.
