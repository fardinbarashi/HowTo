# This step is not necessary since it makes the DB to a jobserver
## How ever since i want to test the application iam going to do this
### In the production enviroment you should skip this step

```
Iam going to test to make the database server as a jobserver.
In the database server, I have added the service account  ( TEST\svc_oneim_service ) to the local admin group.
The 90 sec value should be changed to 30 sec in a test enviroment
