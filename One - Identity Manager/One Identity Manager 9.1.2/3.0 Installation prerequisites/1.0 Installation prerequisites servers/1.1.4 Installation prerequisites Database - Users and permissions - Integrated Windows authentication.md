Integrated Windows authentication can be used without restriction for the One Identity Manager Service and the web applications. Integrated Windows authentication can be used for FAT clients. Use of Windows groups for logging in is supported. To ensure functionality it is strongly recommended you use SQL login.

    Set up an SQL login for the user account on the database server.

    Enter dbo as the default schema.

    Assign the required permissions SQL login.
