## Target System Synchronization
A server installed with the One Identity Manager Service and, if necessary, other target system specific software, is required for synchronizationClosed. This server 
requires direct access to the target system. The synchronization server communicates directly with the One Identity Manager database by default. You can also set up a connection over an application server for this.
The ideal is one queue per service.

### Added new server functions

### Service Settings
```
If we click on queue we can se that this goes to APP server
And we want to create an queue that goes to our DC-server.
