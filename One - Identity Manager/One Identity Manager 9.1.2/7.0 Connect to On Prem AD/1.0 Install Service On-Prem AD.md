
A server installed with the One Identity Manager Service and, if necessary, other target system specific software, is required for synchronizationClosed. This server 
requires direct access to the target system. The synchronization server communicates directly with the One Identity Manager database by default. You can also set up a connection over an application server for this.
The ideal is one queue per service.
 
we want to create an queue that goes to our DC-server.

![server Test-One-ImMaster](https://github.com/fardinbarashi/Howto/blob/main/One%20-%20Identity%20Manager/One%20Identity%20Manager%209.1.2/6.0%20Install%20IM%20Service%20on%20Appserver/IMG/100.png)
