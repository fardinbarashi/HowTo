1. Installation user                               The installation user is required for the initial setup of a One Identity Manager database using the Configuration Wizard.
2. Administrative user                             The administrative user is used by components of One Identity Manager that require authorizations at server level and database level, for example, the Configuration Wizard, the DBQueue Processor, or the One Identity Manager Service.
3. Configuration user                              The configuration user can run configuration tasks within the One Identity Manager, for example, creating customer-specific schema extensions or working with the Designer. Configuration users need permissions at the server and database levels.
4. End users                                       End users are only assigned permissions at database level in order, for example, to complete tasks with the Manager or the Web Portal.
