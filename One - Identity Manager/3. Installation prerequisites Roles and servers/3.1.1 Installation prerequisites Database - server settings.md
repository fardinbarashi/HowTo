Comment : 
1. Select English as the default language for database users.
3. Extreme transaction processing supported (Is XTP supported) True One Identity Manager uses In-Memory-OLTP (Online Transactional Processing) for memory-optimized data accesses.
The database server must support extreme transaction processing (XTP). This function is activated by default in a default installation.
The setting is tested by the Configuration Wizard before installing or updating One Identity Manager database. 
If XTP is not activated, the installation or update does not start.
